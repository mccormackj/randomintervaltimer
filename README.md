## Why Random Interval Timers?
When attempting the Pomodoro method, I noticed a couple of ways in which it did not suit me. I found myself getting disrupted by the timer once I had gotten into a focused mindset. I also consistently checked the timer, and noticed my motivation getting lower as the work time approached. When I was introduced to the idea of random interval timing, I created this app to give it a try.

## How long are the work periods?
Since the Pomodoro method improves many people's productivity, I wanted to match the quantity of work spent in that method. In the Pomodoro method, approximately 77% of time is spent on work. To match this, the Random Interval Timer alternates between work periods, ranging from 30 minutes to 70 minutes, and break periods, ranging from 10-20 minutes. In other words, with an average of 50 minutes work time and 15 minutes break time, you'll be working ~77% (15/65) of the time. 

## How do I use it?
Click the Start button to start your current period (work/break), and click pause/resume as needed. When your time period is over, the timer will automatically switch and prepare to start the next period when you press the button. Note that, by nature of the timer's goal, a countdown wil **not** be shown on the timer.

To change your settings, press the "settings" button in the top right corner. A new window will pop up which allows you to adjust the min/max of the work and break periods. Be sure to press the save button before closing this window to ensure your edits are changed.

## Current status
Basic functionalities are working, but future updates will be made for better stylization.
